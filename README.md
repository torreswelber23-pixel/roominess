# Homes AI / Roominess — WhatsApp Operations Platform

This repository is a derivative of Meta's Business Messaging Sample Tech
Provider App. The upstream MIT license and copyright notice are preserved in
[`LICENSE`](LICENSE); additional attribution is documented in
[`NOTICE.md`](NOTICE.md).

The first Homes / Roominess version adds an operations dashboard, persistent
lead and conversation models, a qualification engine, conversation history,
and a forward-compatible foundation for WhatsApp Business Calling, voice
agents, human handoff, appointments, and CRM synchronization.

## Homes quick start

1. Configure the upstream services described below: Meta Developer, Auth0,
   Ably and Neon/Postgres.
2. Apply the upstream tables and then run [`database/schema.sql`](database/schema.sql).
3. Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and set only real credentials. Never
   commit `.env.local`.
4. Run `npm install`, `npm run lint:all`, `npm test`, and `npm run build`.
5. Subscribe the Meta webhook to `messages`; for Calling-enabled accounts,
   also subscribe to `calls`.

See [`docs/SETUP.md`](docs/SETUP.md) for the complete service checklist and
[`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for module boundaries and the
current functional scope.

# Upstream: Business Messaging Sample Tech Provider App

A [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) reference application that demonstrates how tech providers can integrate with Meta's [WhatsApp Business Platform](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/cloud-api/get-started). It covers the full lifecycle — onboarding businesses via Embedded Signup, managing WhatsApp Business Accounts, sending and receiving messages, and handling webhooks.

## Demo

**New to this app?** Watch the step-by-step video walkthrough that covers everything you need to get up and running — creating accounts (Vercel, Auth0, Ably), deploying the app, setting up the Meta Developer app, and configuring the database.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- **Node.js 18.18+** (required by Next.js 15)
- An [Ably](https://ably.com/) account and app
- An [Auth0](https://auth0.com/) account and application
- A [Meta Developer](https://developers.facebook.com/) account
- A **verified Meta Business** — your business must have completed [Business Verification](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/development/release/business-verification). You will need to select this verified business when connecting your app.

## Getting Started

Choose one of the two paths below:

---

### Option A: Deploy to Vercel (Recommended)

**Step 1 — Deploy**

Click the button below to deploy to a new Vercel project. The flow will prompt you to fork the repo, connect a Neon Postgres database, and set environment variables.

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Ffbsamples%2Fbusiness-messaging-sample-tech-provider-app&env=ABLY_KEY,APP_BASE_URL,AUTH0_DOMAIN,AUTH0_CLIENT_ID,AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET,AUTH0_SECRET,FB_APP_ID,FB_APP_SECRET,FB_GRAPH_API_VERSION,FB_REG_PIN,FB_VERIFY_TOKEN,TP_CONTACT_EMAIL,PRIVACY_POLICY_URL,PRIVACY_POLICY_HTML&envDescription=PRIVACY_POLICY_URL%20and%20PRIVACY_POLICY_HTML%20are%20optional.%20You%20may%20provide%20either%20one%20or%20enter%20None%20for%20both.%20See%20the%20README%20for%20detailed%20descriptions%20of%20the%20variables%20to%20configure%20the%20app.&envLink=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Ffbsamples%2Fbusiness-messaging-sample-tech-provider-app%23environment-variables&products=%5B%7B%22type%22%3A%22integration%22%2C%22integrationSlug%22%3A%22neon%22%2C%22productSlug%22%3A%22neon%22%2C%22protocol%22%3A%22storage%22%2C%22group%22%3A%22postgres%22%7D%5D)

**Step 2 — Set up the database**

Once deployed, open the Neon dashboard for your project and run the SQL in the [Database Schema](#database-schema) section below.

**Step 3 — Configure external services**

Follow the [Configuration](#configuration) section to set up Ably, Auth0, and your Meta app.

---

### Option B: Local Development

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/fbsamples/business-messaging-sample-tech-provider-app.git
cd business-messaging-sample-tech-provider-app

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Copy the example env file and fill in your values
cp .env.example .env.local

# Start the dev server (runs on https://localhost:3000)
npm run dev
```

The dev server uses Turbopack with experimental HTTPS enabled (required by the Facebook JavaScript SDK).

#### Available Scripts

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `npm run dev` | Start development server |
| `npm run build` | Production build |
| `npm run lint:all` | Run ESLint + TypeScript type-check |
| `npm run test` | Run unit tests (Vitest) |
| `npm run test:e2e` | Run end-to-end tests (Playwright) |

---

## Configuration

This section walks you through setting up each external service the app depends on.

### 1. Ably (Real-time Messaging)

Ably provides real-time WebSocket connections for streaming incoming messages and webhook events to the browser.

1. Create an account at [ably.com](https://ably.com/)
2. Create a new app in the Ably dashboard
3. Copy the **API key (root)** and set it as `ABLY_KEY`

See the [Ably documentation](https://ably.com/docs) for more details.

### 2. Auth0 (Authentication)

Auth0 handles user authentication.

1. Create an account at [auth0.com](https://auth0.com/)
2. Create a new **Regular Web Application**
3. In the application settings, configure:
   - **Allowed Callback URLs**: `https://your-app.vercel.app/auth/callback`
   - **Allowed Logout URLs**: `https://your-app.vercel.app`
4. Copy the **Domain**, **Client ID**, and **Client Secret** into your environment variables

See the [Auth0 Next.js Quickstart](https://auth0.com/docs/quickstart/webapp/nextjs/01-login) for a full walkthrough.

### 3. Meta Developer App

#### Create the app

1. Create a [Meta Developer](https://developers.facebook.com/) account if you don't have one
2. Create a new app and **select the "Connect through WhatsApp" use case** — this is required for the app to work correctly with the WhatsApp Business Platform
3. When prompted to select a business, **choose a business that has completed [Business Verification](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/development/release/business-verification)**. The business must be verified to access WhatsApp Business Platform features.

#### Configure app settings

4. In **App Settings > Basic**:
   - Copy the **App ID** and **App Secret** to your env vars
   - Add your Vercel deployment domain to **App Domains**

#### Configure Facebook Login for Business

5. In the **Facebook Login for Business** product settings:
   - Add your deployment URL to **Valid OAuth Redirect URIs** (e.g. `https://your-app.vercel.app/`)
   - Add your deployment URL to **Allowed Domains for the JavaScript SDK**

#### Configure WhatsApp webhooks

6. In the **WhatsApp** product settings:
   - Set the **Callback URL** to `https://your-app.vercel.app/api/webhooks`
   - Set the **Verify Token** to the same value as your `FB_VERIFY_TOKEN` env var
   - Subscribe to the `messages` webhook field

#### Add testers (Development mode)

7. Add testers via **App Roles** — only users with a role on the app can use it in Development mode.

### 4. Database Setup

After deploying, run the following SQL in your Neon dashboard (or any PostgreSQL client connected to your database) to create the required tables. Each table stores data shared by businesses during the Embedded Signup flow. The `user_id` column scopes all data to the authenticated tech provider user.

## Environment Variables

Set these in `.env.local` for local development or in your Vercel project settings for production.

```env
# Auth0
APP_BASE_URL='https://your-deployment-url.vercel.app'
AUTH0_DOMAIN='your-tenant.auth0.com'
AUTH0_CLIENT_ID='your-auth0-client-id'
AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET='your-auth0-client-secret'
AUTH0_SECRET='a-long-random-string-for-session-encryption'

# Meta / Facebook

# Ably
ABLY_KEY='your-ably-api-key'

# Contact
TP_CONTACT_EMAIL='your-contact-email@example.com'

# Privacy Policy (optional)
# If set, the /privacy route redirects to this URL. Leave unset to serve the
# built-in placeholder page at /privacy instead.
# PRIVACY_POLICY_URL='https://example.com/privacy'
# Alternatively, if no valid URL is set, provide the policy as inline HTML.
# PRIVACY_POLICY_HTML='<h1>Privacy Policy</h1><p>Last updated: ...</p>'

# Database (auto-configured when using Vercel + Neon integration)
# POSTGRES_URL='postgres://...'
```

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `APP_BASE_URL` | Your deployment URL (e.g. `https://your-app.vercel.app`). Used by Auth0 for redirects. |
| `AUTH0_DOMAIN` | Your Auth0 tenant domain (e.g. `your-tenant.auth0.com`). |
| `AUTH0_CLIENT_ID` | Auth0 application client ID. |
| `AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET` | Auth0 application client secret. |
| `AUTH0_SECRET` | A long random string used to encrypt Auth0 session cookies. Generate with `openssl rand -hex 32`. |
| `FB_APP_ID` | Your Meta app ID from the [Meta Developer Dashboard](https://developers.facebook.com/apps/). |
| `FB_APP_SECRET` | Your Meta app secret (App Settings > Basic). |
| `FB_GRAPH_API_VERSION` | Graph API version to use (e.g. `v22.0`). |
| `FB_REG_PIN` | A 6-digit PIN used when registering WhatsApp phone numbers. |
| `FB_VERIFY_TOKEN` | A secret string you choose — Meta sends it during webhook verification to prove it's you. |
| `ABLY_KEY` | API key from your [Ably dashboard](https://ably.com/accounts). |
| `TP_CONTACT_EMAIL` | Contact email displayed in the app. |
| `PRIVACY_POLICY_URL` | _Optional._ URL of a privacy policy hosted elsewhere. If it is a valid `http(s)://` URL, `/privacy` redirects there. During Deploy to Vercel, enter `None` if you do not have one. |
| `PRIVACY_POLICY_HTML` | _Optional._ Inline privacy policy HTML, used only when `PRIVACY_POLICY_URL` is not a valid URL. During Deploy to Vercel, enter `None` if you do not have one. If neither option is provided, `/privacy` shows the built-in placeholder page. For local development, leave both variables unset. |
| `POSTGRES_URL` | PostgreSQL connection string. Auto-set when you connect Neon via Vercel. |

## Going to Production

The steps above are sufficient for development and testing with app admins and testers. To make your app available to external businesses, complete the following checklist:

- [ ] **Replace the privacy policy** — The app includes a placeholder at `/privacy`. Either set the `PRIVACY_POLICY_URL` env var to redirect `/privacy` to a policy you host elsewhere, or replace the content of `app/privacy/page.tsx` with your own. Then set the URL in **App Settings > Basic > Privacy Policy URL**.
- [ ] **Create a Tech Provider Configuration** — In the Meta Developer Dashboard, create at least one Tech Provider Configuration (config ID). The app fetches these dynamically and uses them to launch Embedded Signup.
- [ ] **Complete Business Verification** — Your business must be verified before your app can access production data from other businesses. See [Business Verification](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/development/release/business-verification).
- [ ] **Submit for App Review** — Request the permissions your app needs. See [App Review](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/resp-plat-initiatives/app-review). At minimum, request:
  - `whatsapp_business_management` — manage WABAs, phone numbers, templates, and webhook subscriptions
  - `whatsapp_business_messaging` — send text and template messages
  - Additional permissions based on your use case: `pages_show_list`, `catalog_management`, `ads_read`
- [ ] **Publish your App** — Go to App Dashboard > **Publish** and click the publish button. In Unpublished mode, only users with a role on the app can use it.
- [ ] **Verify webhook configuration** — Confirm the callback URL (`https://your-domain/api/webhooks`), verify token, and `messages` field subscription are set in **WhatsApp > Configuration**.
- [ ] **Verify OAuth redirect URIs** — Confirm your deployment URL is listed in **Facebook Login for Business > Valid OAuth Redirect URIs** and **Allowed Domains for the JavaScript SDK**.
